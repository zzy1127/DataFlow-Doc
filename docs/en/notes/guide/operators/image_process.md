# Introduction to Image Data Processors
Note: We have set up corresponding filters for each scorer, named following the rules ```MetricnameScorer``` and ```MetricFilter```. Please refer to the [image_metrics.md](./image_metrics.md) for an introduction to these filters. The following introduces only the processors that differ from the previous scorers.
