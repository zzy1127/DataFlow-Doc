## Word Overlap Based

| BLEU Scorer          | Fluency and Lexical Match | Machine Translation, Text Generation | Calculates precision based on n-gram matching by comparing n-grams in generated and reference texts | [0, 1]         | Higher values indicate greater match between generated and reference texts | Suitable for large datasets, simple and efficient | Performs poorly at sentence level, insensitive to synonyms and word order |
| ROUGE Scorer         | Content Overlap      | Text Summarization   | Calculates overlap between generated and reference summaries using n-gram and longest common subsequence matching | [0, 1]         | Higher values indicate more content overlap between generated and reference texts | Easy to use, applicable to various text generation tasks | Limited semantic understanding |
| METEOR Scorer        | Semantic Matching    | Machine Translation  | Calculates alignment scores between generated and reference texts based on stemming, synonym matching, and semantic relevance | [0, 1]         | Higher values indicate stronger semantic consistency between generated and reference texts | More sensitive to semantic similarity than BLEU, closer to human evaluation | High computational complexity |
| CIDEr Scorer         | Content Relevance   | Image Caption Generation | Uses TF-IDF weighted n-gram statistics to compare similarity between generated and reference descriptions | [0, 1]         | Higher values indicate stronger content consistency between generated and reference texts | Considers the weight of words in the reference text, suitable for image-to-text tasks | Strong influence of low-frequency words |
| CHRF Scorer | Lexical Matching | Machine Translation | Calculates the chrF score based on character-level n-gram precision and recall between the reference text and the evaluated text | [0, 1] | The higher the value, the stronger the semantic similarity | Allows for more fine-grained understanding | Ignores semantic information |

| Embedding Average Score      | Semantic Similarity  | Text Generation      | Computes cosine similarity of the average word embeddings of generated and reference texts     | [0, 1]         | Higher values indicate stronger semantic similarity | Simple and efficient, suitable for quick computations | Cannot capture complex semantic structures |
| Greedy Matching Score        | Semantic Relevance   | Text Generation      | Matches semantically similar words between generated and reference texts, computes similarity   | [0, 1]         | Higher values indicate stronger semantic relevance | Captures local similarity                     | Ignores global semantic structure            |
